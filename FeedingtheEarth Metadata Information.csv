Food Balances,Food Balances,"The food balance provides a comprehensive picture of the structure of a country's food
supply over a specific reference period.
 Food balance  shows the source of each food and its uses, that is, each major raw material and a set of processed raw materials that can be potentially consumed by humans.
 The total amount of food produced in a country is added to the total imports, adjusting for changes in stocks  since the start of the base period to give the amount of supply available during that period.
 On the usage side, a distinction is made between export volumes, livestock feed volumes, usage as seeds, processing volumes for food  and non-food purposes, losses in storage and transportation, and food reserves available for human consumption.
 The per capita supply of each  food product that can be consumed by humans is determined by dividing the corresponding amount by relevant data about the population that actually consumes it.
 Per capita food supply data are expressed in volume and also in terms of caloric value, protein and fat content, using appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products.
